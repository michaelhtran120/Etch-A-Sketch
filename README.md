#The Odin Project Foundations Project #2

Building out Etch-A-Sketch toy via Javascript.

## Rules:

1. Create 16 x 16 grid of square divs using Javascript.
2. Allowed to create a container in html file for divs to reside.
3. Set up a hover effect that will leave a pixelated trail through the grid.
4. Add a button that will allow the user to clear the grid and also prompting user how many squares per side to make a new grid within the same total space as before.

## Own Personal Addition

1. Added a button that will randomly generate a color to use on the grid.
2. (Tentative: Create a button that increases the opacity.)
